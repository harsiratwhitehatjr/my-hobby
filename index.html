			<p>When you're baking you know what you're going to do next. You can concentrate completely on what you're doing and it ends up acting as a form of meditation. Activities like cooking are nurturing activities. You feel amazing because what you make is going to feed people which is a very fulfilling activity.One thing I love about baking is that it always feels a little bit indulgent, a little bit unnecessary. I don't have to bake anything, but when I do, it's because I want to devote my time to making myself or someone else happy. Simply making that decision feels like a gift to myself. Baking is a communal experience.</p>
